##Spotter Project

Spotter is a single-page social media Twitter clone that allows the user to login with their Spotify account, and then search for their favourite songs and post them for other users to like.

A stretch feature that we included was adding a Spotify Player at the bottom of the page. It allows for you to play music off of multiple devices.
