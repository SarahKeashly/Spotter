##Spotter Project

Spotter is a single-page social media Twitter clone that allows the user to login with their Spotify account, and then search for their favourite songs and post them for other users to like.

A stretch feature that we included was adding a Spotify Player at the bottom of the page. It allows for you to play music off of multiple devices.

The open source player that was used is competing for state with our react application, so unfortunately the player does not always work in the browser.
