MIDTERM QUESTIONS:

ERDS:::
How would I go about adding notifications? something similar to twitter where whenever somone reacts with your tweet it gives you a notification

For messaging, would it be easier to just AJAX msgs with each user being convo x (i.e. user 1 and user 2 convo is convo1), and how would that fit in the DB?
two join tables
many-many-many
sender -> msg -> reciever

spotify uses:
AUTH_URL : spotify authorization url, add permissions that users can read (optional, making the auth url a permission from spotify instead) -> url code
save code url to profile
access_token
refresh_token


MVP:
can listen*(first?)
can CRUD tweets (own)
can like/interact with post
can like via spotify
login links up with spotify
can login
has profiles
notifications

playerbar:
- toggle for viewing/hiding

profilepage:
- (amount) following + (amount) followers
- joined date

settings:
- light/dark mode toggle
- header as faviroute song (maybe settings)

stretch/flex:
- add conversations
